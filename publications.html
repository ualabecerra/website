                     <p>We have recently designed FSA-SPARQL, an extension of the SPARQL query language for querying fuzzy RDF datasets. Answers of FSA-SPARQL queries are usually annotated with truth degrees which are computed from fuzzy connectives and operators that act on truth degrees associated to RDF triples. While FSA-SPARQL offers a rich repertoire of fuzzy connectives and operators, it is not always easy to retrieve the user’s expected answers. This is very often due to wrong formulation of queries, caused by inadequate use/combination of fuzzy connectives, operators and thresholds. For instance, a high threshold for truth degrees in some RDF datasets can lead to an empty set of answers, some strong or weak restrictive combination of fuzzy conditions might produce few or too many answers, etc. On the other hand, our research group has also developed the fuzzy logic programming language FASILL, which has been equipped with tuning techniques for enabling the customization of queries from test cases. In this paper, our goals are: (1) to provide a FSA-SPARQL translation to FASILL and (2) apply the tuning techniques to FSA-SPARQL queries for getting more precise formulation of queries from test cases.</p>

                     <p>In recent years, Open Street Map (OSM) has evolved into a highly popular geospatial system. The key of success of OSM is that OSM is open to absolutely everyone. OSM is not dependent on any one government, company, university, or international organization. OSM is based on crowdsourcing, in which users collaborate to collect spatial data of urban and rural areas on the earth. With the arising of Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative, and more concretely with Linked Geo Open Data (LGOD), many Web resources have been made available to everyone, providing geo-located datasets. In this paper a framework, called XOSM (XQuery for OpenStreetMap), for integrating and querying OSM and LGOD resources is presented. The framework is equipped with a Web tool and a rich XQuery-based library, enabling the definition of queries combining OSM layers and layers created from LGOD resources (KML, GeoJSON, CSV and RDF (and also XML)). The framework also provides an API to execute XQuery queries using the library.</p>

The approach uses Taginfo as a reference base and analyses quality measures such as completeness, compliance, consistence, granularity, richness and trust . The framework has been used to analyze the quality of OpenStreetMap in Spain, comparing the main cities of Spain. Also a comparison between Spain and some major European cities has been carried out.

                     <p>Property-based testing has gained popularity in recent years in many areas of software development. The specification of assertions/properties helps to understand the semantics of pieces of code and, in modern programming environments, it can serve to test the program behavior. In this paper an XQuery property- based testing tool is presented which enables to automatically test XQuery programs. The tool is able to systematically generate XML instances (i.e., test cases) from a given XML schema, and to filter XML instances with input properties specified by the programmer. Additionally, the tool automatically checks output (respectively, input-output) properties in each output instance (respectively, each pair of input-output instances). The tool is able to report whether the XQuery program passes the test, that is, if all the test cases satisfy the (input-)output property, as well as the number of test cases used for testing. In addition, if the XQuery program fails the test, the tool shows counterexamples found in the test cases. Properties are specified with XQuery Boolean functions, and the testing tool has been implemented in XQuery. Additionally, an XQuery path validation tool is presented. This tool is able to detect wrong paths in XQuery expressions. The path validation tool takes as input an XML Schema and it reports those paths on the XQuery program that do not match the XML Schema. The path validation tool is a complement to the testing tool rejecting XQuery programs that do not conform to the XML Schema. The path validation tool has been also implemented in XQuery. Finally, a Web tool has been developed enabling to test and validate XQuery programs.</p>

The exploitation of data coming from such resources requires an additional effort in the form of tools and effective processing techniques. One of the most established VGI is Open Street Map (OSM) offering data of urban and rural maps from the earth. In this paper we present a library for querying OSM with XQuery. This library is based on the well-known spatial operators defined by Clementini and Egenhofer, providing a repertoire of XQuery functions which encapsulate the search on the XML document representing a layer of OSM, and make the definition of queries on top of OSM layers easy. In essence, the library is equipped with a set of OSM Operators for OSM elements which, in combination with Higher Order facilities of XQuery, facilitates the composition of queries and the definition of keyword based search geo-localized queries. OSM data are indexed by an R-tree structure, in which OSM elements are enclosed by Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs), in order to get shorter answer time.</p>

Thirdly, the tool is able to filter randomly generated test cases with input properties, as well as to test output and input-output properties on randomly generated test cases and the corresponding output.

                     <p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very ﬂexible text format derived from SGML. Originally designed to meet the challenges of large-scale electronic publishing, XML is also playing an increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web and elsewhere. XPath language is the result of an eﬀort to provide address parts of an XML document. In support of this primary purpose, it becomes in a query language against an XML document. In this paper we present a proposal for the implementation of the XPath language in logic programming. With this aim we describe the representation of XML documents by means of a logic program. Rules and facts can be used for representing the document schema and the XML document itself. In particular, we will present how to index XML documents in logic programs: rules is supposed to be stored in main memory, however facts are stored in secondary memory by using two kind of indexes: one for each XML tag, and other for each group of terminal items. In addition, we study how to query by means of the XPath language against a logic program representing an XML document. It evolves the specialization of the logic program with regard to the XPath expression. Finally, we will also explain how to combine the indexing and the top-down evaluation of the logic program.</p>

                     <p>Functional logic programming is a paradigm which integrates functional and logic programming. It is based on the use of rewriting rules for defining of programs, and rewriting for goal solving. In this context, goals, usually, consist of equality (and, sometimes, inequality) constraints, which are solved in order to obtain answers, represented by means of substitutions. On the other hand, database programming languages involve a data model, a data definition language and, finally, a query language against the data defined according to the data model. To use functional logic programming as database programming language, (1) we will propose a data model involving the main features adopted from functional logic programming (for instance, handling of partial and infinite data), (2) we will use conditional rewriting rules as data definition language, and finally, (3) we will deal with equality and inequality constraints as query language. Moreover, as most database systems, (4) we will propose an extended relational calculus and algebra, which can be used as alternative query languages in this framework. Finally, (5) we will prove that three alternative query languages are equivalent.</p>

The extended relational calculus is based on the relational first-order logic, by adding constraints in the form of equalities and disequalities over complex (partially defined and possibly infinite) values and interpreted functions. In addition, we propose the notion of safety over calculus formulas in order to guarantee the property of domain independence. In the case of the extended relational algebra, we provide a generalization of the selection and projection operators in order to restructure complex values by means of constructors and destructors, interpreted functions and function inverses, as well as, to consider equality and disequality constraints. Finally, we will state that the two query formalisms (calculus and algebra) are equivalent.</p>

                     <p>This paper adds the handling of negative information to a functional-logic deductive database language. By adopting as semantics for negation the so-called CRWLF, wherein the negation is intended as 'finite failure' of reduction, we will define Herbrand algebras and models for this semantics and a fix point operator to be used in a new goal-directed bottom-up evaluation mechanism based on magic transformations. This bottom-up evaluation will simulate the top-down one of the original program; in fact, it will carry out a goal-directed lazy evaluation.</p>

                     <p>In this paper we start the design of a functional-logic deductive database language. Given that most logic deductive languages consider bottom-up evaluation as operational mechanism, here we will focus on the development of an operational semantics based on bottom-up evaluation for functional logic languages. As in the logic paradigm, the bottom-up evaluation will consist in a magic transformation for a given program-query into a magic program-query for which the bottom-up evaluation will simulate the top-down one of the original program.</p>
